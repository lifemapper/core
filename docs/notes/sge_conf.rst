SGE Configuration Notes

Reporting and accouting
-----------------------

  These files are generated by SGE for accouting and job reporting.  We do not do anything with these files.  In fact, the documentation at http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman5/sge_conf.html indicates that we should turn off these files (reporting especially) unless there is something consuming them.  To turn them off, call qconf -mconf and change the reporting_params parameter.
  
  .. code-block ::
  
    # qconf -mconf
  
  
  Turn off accouting and reporting by setting the value in reporting_params to 'false', example:
  
  .. code-block ::

    reporting_params		accounting=false reporting=false \
		  		flush_time=00:00:15 joblog=true sharelog=00:00:00
