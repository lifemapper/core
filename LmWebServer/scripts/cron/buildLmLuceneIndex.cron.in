# Set environment in case it is not already set
. /etc/profile.d/lifemapper.sh

# Have to export PYTHONPATH or the modules will not be found
#   CJG (10/21/2015): I don't think that this is true now, test this
export PYTHONPATH=@LMHOME@

# Build the index
# Note that the output of this could be piped to a file to check for success
#   or you can check the last modified time of the files in: 
#   @LMWEB@/luceneIndex/
