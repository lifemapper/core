"""This module provides hooks for CherryPy threads to DB connections

The db plugin module provides a hook for CherryPy threads so that each will
have its own database connection.

Note:
    * This may need to evolve to be a true 'CherryPy Plugin' but we will
        classify it as a plugin because it is attached to a thread and that
        can / will exist for multiple requests.  Whereas a CherryPy Tool only
        exists for one request.
    * psycopg2 is supposed to be thread safe, so this is not really necessary
          and we could use a tool, but this will limit the overall number of
          connections.
