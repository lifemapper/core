   <h2>Lifemapper Macroecology Plugin Tutorial</h2>
   <p>
   The macroecology plugin comes with a sample data folder with three species shapefiles from <a href="http://www.natureserve.org/">
   NatureServe</a>. 
   <p>
   1.) Start a new experiment, sign in to the Lifemapper system by using the sign in dialog from the "Sign In" menu item
   in the "Macroecology" plugin. After providing your credentials click "New Experiment". The New Experiment dialog will
   appear.
   </p>
   <p>
   2.) Give the experiment the name "Tutorial", Define the EPSG projection field by typing 4326 (this is the same projection
   as the sample data. Or use the Projection Selector dialog to choose WGS 84. The email field for job notification is optional.
   </p>
   <p>
   3.) Choose the "Define Input Grid" radio button and click "OK".  This will open the Construct Grid dialog
   </p>
   <p>
   4.) Fill out the required fields in the Construct Grid Dialog. For "Cell Shape" choose square. For "Cell Size in map units" enter 2. This means 2 degrees.
   Browse your file system for a filename and location. Give the grid a name.  Double check that all fields are filled. 
   Use the "?" button to get help with this dialog or any dialog. Click "OK". After a short wait a grid should be downloaded and added to your map canvas.
   </p>
   <p>
   5.) Choose "Add Local Species Layers" radio button in the new experiment dialog and click "OK". This opens the Add Layers dialog. Add the three
   species layers from the lifemapperTools/sampledata folder that came with the plugin. Fill out the appropriate fields
   for your data.  To set the Presence Attribute field, double click on a cell in that column, a drop down list will appear
   with the field names in the shapefile.  Choose "PRESENCE".  Set the other fields for all three layers by entering a 
   value in a cell. You can use a column mode to set all of the fields by right clicking on a cell with a value. Click the 
   "Add to Experiment" button, a progress bar will appear indicating the progress of the upload.  You should get a message
   tell you that 3 out of 3 layers were uploaded and added to your experiment.
   </p>
   <p>
   6.) Choose "List Grids" radio button in the new experiment dialog and click "OK".  This opens up the Grid Listing Dialog.  
   You will see a record for your grid in the table.  Select that row.  Click the "Intersect" button.  A progress bar will appear
   and may cycle through a couple of times.  When it stops, you will prompted to give a file location and name. There will be 
   an "Add to Map", click it and the intersected grid with the PAM information will be added to your map canvas and table of 
   contents.
   </p>
   <p>
   7.) The status of the grid in the grid listing dialog should be "complete" with the status "compressed".  Now click on the calculate
   button.  Wait for the calculate process to complete.
   </p>
   <p>
   8.) Now click the "Get Stats" button, this will open the Statistics dialog.  Choose "All from the radio buttons on the left side and 
   then choose the original pam from the drop down box.  Choose the "Site based" radio button from the statistics controls on the right
   hand side and then choose "All Site-based Stats" from the drop down list.  Click view in table.  A table with your stats for 
   every site in the grid will be populated.  You can now select two columns by clicking on the data, and holding down the Ctrl.key
   to select two columns.  Click the "Scatter Plot" button, a scatter plot of the two vectors of data from the data will be plotted in a 
   plot window that appears.
   </p>
   <p>
   You have completed the basic steps for a basic range and diversity experiment using a presence absence matrix generated
   from the Lifemapper system.  There is plenty of other functionality, use the help system for each dialog by clicking the "?"
   button for each dialog to find other features.  Have fun!
